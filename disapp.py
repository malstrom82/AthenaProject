The problem with this dataset is that we know that at least 50% of the articles are correctly labeled as disinformation. The remaining 50% is labeled as “fake news” or “non-credible” by the creator of the WELfake dataset and could thereby be a mix of misinformation and disinformation making it unclear what is being predicted.
